Let's set up a {{.Balance}} shared data pack for your company.

Can you please reply with the following:
1. The company domain
2. A company email address that can be used to verify the request

After we get this set up, anyone who already has or creates a new network associated with a company domain email will automatically get access to the shared data. You can direct your team to contact <support@bringyour.com> for any help.
