# Go Style Guide

In the URnetwork code, the following Go style is used. A few conventions — notably the `self` receiver name and the verbose usage+type field naming — intentionally diverge from idiomatic Go; they are deliberate house rules, not oversights.

## Naming

- Our receiver name is `self`: `func (self *T) f(...)` (pointer receiver) or `func (self T) f(...)` (value receiver).
- Our canonical name for a `sync.Mutex` guarding state is `stateLock`.
- Field and variable names are slightly more verbose than standard Go, so usage and type can be inferred from the name. The scheme is usage + type:
  - Maps: `map[K]V` is `usageKVs` — e.g. `activeNetworkIdUsers` for a `map[Id]User` of active users. Note the plural `s`.
  - Slices: `[]T` is `usageTs` — e.g. `activeNetworkIds` for a `[]Id` of active networks. Note the plural `s`.
  - Variables: `T` is `usageT` — e.g. `activeNetworkId` for the active network `Id`.
  - Use the shortest type token that stays unambiguous: `Id`, not `Identifier`; but never abbreviate past recognition (`activeNetworkIds`, not `activeNetIds`).
  - When the value already implies its type, drop the type token: concrete objects are named by usage alone (`session`, `client`, `transferBalance`). Keep the type when dropping it would confuse an identifier with the object it names — an `Id` stays `clientId`, never `client`.

## Comments

- Prefer short inline comments (`// ...` inside a function), 1–2 lines per point unless more is truly needed.
- Put a doc comment at the top of each file, type, and function/method declaration, summarizing the architecture and edge cases. These can be as long as needed, but aim to be concise. Push information that applies throughout a type or file up to the type or file header instead of repeating it — in particular, concurrent goroutine safety.

## Concurrency and goroutine safety

- By default, package-level functions are assumed safe for concurrent use, and a type's methods are assumed NOT safe unless the type documents otherwise.
- Hold a lock across the smallest scope that needs it. The idiom is an immediately-invoked closure: `func() { self.stateLock.Lock(); defer self.stateLock.Unlock(); ... }()`.
- Every potentially infinite loop must take a context (for cancellation) and rate-limit itself (to avoid busy-spinning).
- Use `connect.Reconnect` for reconnect rate limiting.
- Use `connect.Monitor` for change notifications. Grab the channel before reading the monitored state — `update := monitor.NotifyChannel()` — then `select` on it while waiting for changes. Subscribing before the read guarantees an update can't be missed.

## Goroutine lifecycle

- Start a type's internal management goroutines in its constructor, so the returned object is already fully running. The lifecycle loop is conventionally `func (self *T) run()` — lowercase, internal, started by the constructor.
- Exception: when an external manager must clean up after the lifecycle, expose `func (self *T) Run()` (uppercase) instead. The manager calls `Run()` after construction and tears the object down when `Run()` returns. Casing carries the meaning: lowercase `run()` is internal and self-started; uppercase `Run()` is externally driven.
- Wait with `time.After` inside the run loop; we don't use `time.Timer`. Reusing a `time.Timer` would save the per-iteration allocation, but we don't optimize for that.

## Formatting and structure

- Format with `gofmt`.
- Inline single-use helper logic as a local closure at its call site (`f := func(...){ ... }; f()`) rather than pulling it out into a separate named function.
