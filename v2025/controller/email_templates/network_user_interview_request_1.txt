The future internet

I want to hear from you

I started BringYour - https://bringyour.com - to put the best technology for content, privacy, and security directly into users' hands. At BringYour we're stepping into the future internet today. I'd like to know -

What does your ideal future internet look like?

Would you be able to do a 15 minute interview to discuss? You can book a time here - https://calendly.com/bringyour/feedback - or send me an email reply - brien@bringyour.com

Not only do you have my commitment to build the best internet tools for you, but I'd like to send you a gift for sharing your input also - a 2TiB data code.
